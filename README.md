A Picker component for React Native which emulates the native `<select>` interfaces for iOS and Android

For iOS, by default we are wrapping an unstyled TextInput component. You can then pass down styles to customize it to your needs.

For Android, by default we are using the native Picker component. If you prefer, you can set `useNativeAndroidPickerStyle` to false, which will also render an unstyled TextInput component. You can then pass down styles to customize it to your needs.

For either platform, you can alternatively pass down a child element of your choice that will be wrapped in a touchable area.

### Styling

All properties mentioned below must be nested under the `style` prop. Examples of different styling options can be found [on the example snack](https://snack.expo.io/@lfkwtz/react-native-picker-select).

#### iOS-specific

-   The component wraps a TextInput without styling. You can target the TextInput styling with `inputIOS`.
-   Other styles that can be modified for iOS are named `inputIOSContainer`, `placeholder`, `viewContainer`, `chevronContainer`, `chevron`, `chevronUp`, `chevronDown`, `chevronActive`, `done`, `modalViewTop`, `modalViewMiddle`, and `modalViewBottom`

#### Android-specific

-   The native Picker in its inactive state acts looks similar to a TextInput, but it has limitations on custom styling. Any styling that is possible can be applied via `inputAndroid`.
-   You can add some styling customization to the active-state native Picker, [but that requires modifying some xml files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39141949/1437023)
-   If you set the prop `useNativeAndroidPickerStyle` to false, the component will allow a few other style objects: `inputAndroidContainer`, `placeholder`, and `inputAndroid`
-   Other styles that can be modified for Android are named `headlessAndroidContainer` and `viewContainer`

### Icon

-   If a component is passed in via the `Icon` prop - it will be rendered with `{ position: 'absolute', right: 0 }` applied to its wrapping container. You can modify these values and add additional spacing to position the icon as needed by modifying `iconContainer`. You'll probably also want to add some `paddingRight` to your input styling to avoid any longer text appearing behind the icon.
-   You can pass a component of your choosing (css, image, svg, etc..) for use as the icon. For ease of use, consider a library such as [react-native-shapes](https://github.com/lfkwtz/react-native-shapes) or [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).
-   Examples of different icons and their usage can be found [on the example snack](https://snack.expo.io/@lfkwtz/react-native-picker-select).
