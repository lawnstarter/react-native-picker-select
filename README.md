A Picker component for React Native which emulates the native `<select>` interfaces for iOS and Android

For iOS, we are wrapping a TextInput component. You can pass down your custom styling to match your other inputs.

For Android, we are using the native Picker component, but adding a pseudo-underline to emulate a typical TextInput. Additional styling can be passed down also to further customize the appearance.

For either platform, you can alternatively pass down a child element that will be wrapped in a touchable area, triggering the picker.

### Styling

-   iOS
    -   The component wraps a TextInput without styling. In the style prop, pass a style object named `inputIOS` to style the input
    -   Alternatively, you can pass children (such as a custom button or input) for the component to wrap
    -   Other styles that can be modified for iOS are named `viewContainer`, `icon`, `done`, `modalViewTop`, `modalViewMiddle`, `modalViewBottom`, and `placeholderColor`
-   Android
    -   The default Picker component acts similiarly to a TextInput until it is tapped, although it does not include an underline
    -   We emulate a typical underline, which can be modified with a style object named `underline`
    -   The main input can be modified with the style object named `inputAndroid`
    -   Alternatively, you can pass children (such as a custom button or input) for the component to wrap
    -   Other styles that can be modified for Android are named `viewContainer` and `placeholderColor`
